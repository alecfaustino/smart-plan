### Idea

- Target: Small teams
- Trello but add an algorithm that auto assigns tasks to a user based on:
  - A working window that a user sets for themselves
  - The duration of the task.
  - Priority level of the task
  - Future: Assign Level to the user and a level to the task such that an admin can set the task level. By default, any user can be assigned a task equal or lower level. However, if teams don't want to assign a senior level member a junior level tasks, they can create a setting for it.

### Phase 1

- A single user can authenticate, add tasks, and apply algorithm to auto schedule their tasks.
- A single user can reschedule tasks
- A single user can schedule tasks
- A single user can delete tasks
- A single user can set their working window
- No team assignment, No team logic.
